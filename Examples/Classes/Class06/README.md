Putting it all together!
In this class we will present some basic activities around HTML pages, the students need to build three different pages following the instructions and link these pages using the tag <a>

## Workflow

In the first page the students will explain how and when HTML was created, ask them to use images and all the tags learned until now.

> Page 2: Photos (30 minutes)
The second page will present a list of photos chosen by the students, they need to find CC photos on the web and put them in their pages.

> Introduction to <a> (30 minutes)
Explain about the tag <a> and how the students can link files using this tag.

> Page 3: Hub (1 hour)
